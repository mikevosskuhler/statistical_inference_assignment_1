# Basic inference  

## Load the data and apply EDA  

```{r}
ToothGrowth <- datasets::ToothGrowth
head(ToothGrowth)
tail(ToothGrowth)
```
## provide a Basic summary  
```{r}
summary(ToothGrowth)
tapply(ToothGrowth$len, list(ToothGrowth$supp, ToothGrowth$dose), mean)
```
## Use Hypothesis tests to compare tooth growth by supp and dose  
```{r}
t.test(len~supp, data = ToothGrowth)
t.test(len~dose, data = ToothGrowth[(ToothGrowth$dose==0.5|ToothGrowth$dose==1),])
t.test(len~dose, data = ToothGrowth[(ToothGrowth$dose==2|ToothGrowth$dose==1),])
```
## Conclusion  
We found significant differences in tooth growth between the different dosage levels but not for the different supps. For this analysis we used two tailled confidence intervals and a significance level alpha of 0.05.
